    {Intro}
    Here we go, so:

    {Refrain}
    Cheese (x5)
    Butter: spread it on the bread
    Bollocks
    Cheese (x7)
    Brown bread!
    Lucy doesn't like cheese
    See you'd have starved in the 70's

    Musical interlude
    {Verse}
    Lurpak spreadable butter
    Line it up, and it's on
    Good man. Cheese
    Other graters, are available
    Rotary graters, this is one of those

    One of them was cheddar
    That's this one here
    Cut from a true wheel
    Red leicester
    The third one, in a small blue pot
    That smelled of sick!

    These are cheese
    Not shade grown
    Not line caught
    Not oak aged
    Not free trade
    Just f**king cheese

    {Refrain}
    Cheese (x5)
    Butter: spread it on the bread
    Bollocks

    {Outro}
    Cheese (x8)

    <img src="el_cheese.jpg" class="cheese">Cheese is a versatile and ancient food, enjoyed for thousands of years across the globe. Made primarily from the curdled milk of cows, goats, sheep, or other mammals, its creation relies on a delicate balance of science and art. The process begins with coagulating milk using rennet or an acid, separating it into curds and whey. The curds are then shaped, salted, and aged to develop their unique textures and flavors. From creamy Brie to sharp Cheddar, cheese offers a spectrum of tastes and styles, catering to virtually every palate.<p>

    Not only is cheese a culinary delight, but it is also rich in nutrients like calcium, protein, and vitamins A and B12. Its variety in taste and application makes it a staple in global cuisines, from the gooey mozzarella on pizza to the tangy blue cheese in a salad. Beyond its role in cooking, cheese is celebrated culturally and economically, with regions such as France and Italy producing iconic varieties that reflect their heritage. This beloved dairy product truly bridges the gap between comfort food and gourmet indulgence.
