        <h1><a href="https://portal.arkansas.gov/">Arkansas</a></h1>
        <p>Arkansas had my favorite website of all the states that we looked at. I liked its color scheme, and its layout.  It has a pretty standard layout.  A menu of links at the top fo the page, a searchbar, and then a bunch more information the further you scroll down.  It workes well in mobile mode too.  The website ran the slowest for me, but it was still pretty fast.  Overall, because of its smooth/simple design I decided to put it at the top.  It was easy to find stuff, so I jsut liked it in general.</p>
        
        <h2><a href="https://portal.kansas.gov/">Kansas</a></h2>
        <p>Kansas's website was pretty similar to Arkansas website in terms of layout/design.  The color schemes were a bit different and it ran slightly slower for me than Arkansas did, but again it was still fast.  I can find things pretty easily, it also has the menu, and search bar at the top of the page, which I tend to like.  It also looks good on different screen sizes.  So, overall it gets second.  Looks almost exactly the same as Arkansas, but I like the color scheme more on Arkansas so this one gets second.</p>
        
        <h3><a href="https://www.maine.gov/portal/index.html">Maine</a></h3>
        <p>Maine is 3rd for me.  The layout, again, is pretty similar to the first two.  It has a menu on the top of the page with a bunch of links and there is also a searchbar.  Maine had the second fastest loading time for me, first was Alaska.  It has some more resource links near the top of the page, which I like.  It however doesn't seem to work well on smaller screen settings.  I also don't like the color scheme as much with this website.  I feels kind of boring.  But is is still designed kind of well so it still gets third.</p>
        
        <h4><a href="https://www.maryland.gov/Pages/default.aspx">Maryland</a></h4>
        <p>Maryland gets 4th.  Hoesntly it was kind of a toss-up between Maryland and Alaska for me.  I still like both of their websites, Maryland just had better colors, and was easier for me to navigate.  Marylands website is super simple, and unique compared to the other.  The menu is on the side instead of the top like all the other websites.  There are a good amount of resources available from the home page, and it loads pretty quickly.  It also works well on smaller screen sizes.  I don't like how little information there is though.  Other state websites have more info in general that Maryland, so it gets 4th.</p>
        
        <h5><a href="https://alaska.gov/">Alaska</a></h5>
        <p>Alaska gets last.  I don't mind Alaska's website layout, the thing is that everything is small, and the color scheme is super boring.  There is a good amount of info though.  It is also the fastest for me.  It also works well on smaller screen settings.  Not much else to say really.  The website is good, its just hard for me to see things because the text is small, which makes it a little hard to navigate.  Because of this it gets last.</p>
