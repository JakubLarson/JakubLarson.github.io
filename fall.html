            <img src="fall.jpg" class="fallimg">
            <p>Fall, also known as autumn, is a season of transformation and harvest, beginning in September in the Northern Hemisphere and in March in the Southern Hemisphere. The hallmark of fall is the changing colors of leaves as trees prepare for winter by shedding them. Brilliant reds, oranges, and yellows create a scenic tapestry across forests and neighborhoods, drawing people outdoors to enjoy the fleeting beauty of autumn landscapes. The season also brings shorter days and cooler temperatures, a welcome shift from the heat of summer.</p>

<p>In the agricultural world, fall is often associated with harvest time. Farmers gather crops like pumpkins, apples, and corn, making it a season of abundance and preparation for winter. Many communities celebrate with harvest festivals, where people come together to enjoy local food, crafts, and outdoor activities. This time of year has long been associated with themes of gratitude and reflection, as people pause to appreciate the bounty of nature before winter's arrival.</p>  

<p>Fall is also a season of cozy traditions. Families and friends gather for holidays like Halloween and Thanksgiving, sharing seasonal dishes and enjoying the crisp autumn air. Hot drinks, sweaters, and fireside gatherings add a warm touch to cooler evenings. Fallâ€™s unique blend of beauty, bounty, and tradition makes it a beloved season for many, evoking a sense of comfort and anticipation for what lies ahead.
