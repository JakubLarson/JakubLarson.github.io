    The first website that I will be reviewing is Airbnb.  The first thing that I noticed about this website is that it is simple, which is something that I prefer when looking at a website.  1000 bunch of things don't jump out at you, so its easy to navigate because of that.  It also feels kind of unique.  Normally a website seems to have some add pop up and you've got a big list of links at the top of your screen.  There isn't any of that on this website.  You just scroll down for more information.  It is also formatted really well in my opinion.  Like it is really easy to look at.  I have always had issues with looking at massive walls of words, so websites like this are always nice in my opinion.  I don't recognie lots of Airbnb's source code though.  There is almost 15,000 lines of code, which is insane because most of it just looks the same. But, I think it is modern.  I looked it up online and many people were saying that Airbnb's website was created using multiple languages.  Not sure how accurate that it.  At the top of the code you see "!doctype html", so I'd imagine that most is in HTML.  The layout is layed out in a way that makes sense to me.  It shows you a bunch of places that guests like, some information about Airbnb, and some other little things.  I think the layout is fine.  Navigation is very simple.  There basically isn't really any navigation.  There are some filter options that will navigate you to houses/places to stay with those things you chose in the filter, but other than that there isn't much navigation.  You dont really need it though with how the website is set up.  There also isn't a scrolling effect.  Most of the website is white, with some pink and black.  It isn't super colorful, but I think they did it right.  I could see how some people would think that it is boring though. There aren't really any little things that pop out to me in particular.  There isn't something that is super unique to me, I just think the site is easy to read and simple.

    <h2> <a href="https://www.shopify.com/"></a>Shopify</h2>

    The second website that I am reviewing is Shopify's website.  This website is different than Airbnb's is many ways.  First off, Shopify has a video playing in the background of the screen, which I think is pretty cool.  I also like that it is darker themed, which makes it easire for me to see text.  They have a few reference links at the top of the screen as well as a search bar.  Something else that I like about this website, as well as the Airbnb's website, is that I don't get bombarded with ads.  It makes the website ren a lot smoother.  That being said, Shopify is a little choppier when I scross.  I'd image thats because of the video, but it is still pretty fast.  The source code is way shorter than Airbnb's code.  It also looks modern.  I think this was also written using multiple languages.  I do recognize html elements.  Navigations through the site is pretty easy, and also simple.  Like I mentioned earlier, they have their stuff at the top of the page, and there is also some more information and links further down the page.  It is a pretty simple design in my opinion.  The main color it utilizes is black.  It also uses shades or green and blue.  I really like the color scheme they use.  A little detail that I liked is when you scross down a little, there is some test that changes color when you hover over it.  It also highlights the sentence that work is part of.  I thought that was an interesting touch.

    <h3> <a href="https://www.zara.com/us/"></a>Zara</h3>
    <p>
    The third website that I am reviewing is Zara's website.  This website is interesting.  The screen is covered with videos of people walking around.  Each video takes up like a thrid of the screen.  They have small test over these videos, which makes it hard to read. The site also loaded in really slowly for me.  Most of the test is small and close together.  The website is also bland, basically all just balck and white.  There isn't really any personality, but what would you expect from a fashion website am I right?  The code looks pretty modern.  I see lots of HTML elemtnts all throughout the code.  I can navigate around the website well, although every page still has the same issues the main one does.  All black and white, boring, hard to read text, etc.  I think this website might match their audience, but I'm not really sure.  I just don't like the website.  It feels like I'm on some drama website ran by a paparazzi with how they recorded the people in their videos.  I'm sure some people are into that, but not me personally.  You know how modern art is made fun of for being bad and low effort compared to stuff from the renissance?  This is what that website feels like.  Thats what sets it apart.  I think they tried a little to hard for this website.  Thers a few pictures lower on the webpage, I one is just a bunch of needles and below they talk about their repair service.  Theres another image, I'm not really sure what it is.  It is just a picture of something white.  Maybe its some fabric, but thats what I mean.  It's just vague, and weird.  There was this story I heard about a guy taping a bannana to a wall at an art exibit and then it sold for 100000 dollars.  I think those are th type of people who like this website.
