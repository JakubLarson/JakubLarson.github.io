            <p>Spring is a season of renewal and growth, arriving in March in the Northern Hemisphere and in September in the Southern Hemisphere. As the Earth tilts toward the sun, days grow longer, temperatures rise, and nature awakens from winter dormancy. Trees bud, flowers bloom, and landscapes transform with lush greens and vibrant colors. This burst of life and color marks a fresh start, symbolizing hope and rejuvenation.</p>

<p>In agriculture, spring is a time for planting. Farmers and gardeners begin sowing seeds, knowing that warmer days and rains will support new growth. Animals also respond to the season’s warmth, with many emerging from hibernation and others beginning mating and nesting to raise their young. Birds return from migration, filling the air with song, and pollinators like bees and butterflies become active, playing an essential role in flowering plants’ lifecycle.</p>

<p>Spring brings a sense of joy and celebration for many people. Festivals such as Easter and Holi celebrate themes of rebirth and joy, with outdoor gatherings and colorful traditions. Spring cleaning is also a common ritual, as people open windows, clear out clutter, and refresh their homes. With its warm breezes, bright flowers, and spirit of growth, spring invites everyone to embrace the energy and promise of a new season.
