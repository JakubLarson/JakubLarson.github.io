            <p>The four seasons—spring, summer, fall, and winter—are distinct periods of the year marked by unique weather patterns, daylight hours, and natural changes. This cycle of seasons results from Earth’s tilt as it orbits the sun, causing different areas of the planet to receive varying amounts of sunlight throughout the year. Each season has its own atmosphere and beauty, shaping the rhythms of life, from plant growth to animal behaviors to human traditions.</p>
                
            <p>Together, these seasons create a dynamic and balanced cycle that supports life and marks the passage of time, blending nature’s beauty with opportunities for growth, activity, reflection, and rest.
