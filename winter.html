            <p>Winter is the coldest season of the year, beginning around late December in the Northern Hemisphere and late June in the Southern Hemisphere. It’s marked by shorter days and longer nights, as the Earth tilts away from the sun. This shift results in colder temperatures, frost, and often snow, depending on the region. Winter’s stark landscapes, from snow-capped mountains to frosty forests, inspire seasonal traditions and pastimes.</p>

<p>Animals adapt in unique ways during winter. Many mammals, like bears, hibernate to conserve energy, while others grow thicker fur. Birds in colder regions migrate to warmer areas, while some animals change their coat color to blend in with the snowy environment for camouflage and survival. This season of adaptation also influences the natural world, slowing down plant growth and causing rivers and lakes to freeze over in frigid climates.</p>

<p>People around the world have developed rich traditions for the winter season. Holidays such as Christmas, Hanukkah, and New Year’s are celebrated, often featuring lights, festive meals, and gatherings that brighten the darker months. Winter sports, like skiing, snowboarding, and ice skating, are also popular, drawing outdoor enthusiasts to snowy landscapes for recreation. Despite the cold, winter brings warmth through these seasonal celebrations and activities.
