    <h1>Web Hosting</h1>
    
    <h2> <a href="http://www.bluehost.com">Blue Host</a></h2>
    <p>Blue Host is a highly rated website creation tool, and host that is popular among those who often create website.  They are rated at 4.1 of 5 stars overall on 'TrustPilot.'  They offer namy services, and four different plans for web hosting.  They offer domain services such as AI domain creation tools, and they have a tool that lets you know if a domain name is taken or not, because you can't have two domains with the same name.</p>
    
    <p>The first plan is called 'Basic' and offers what you'll need to make a simple website or a blog.  This plan offers 10 websites, 10 GB of SSD storage, 100 concurrent visitors, free domain for your first year, and many other features.  Their basic plan starts at $2.95/month, and renews at $11.99/month.  </p>
    
    <p>The next plan that Blue Host offers is called 'choice plus'.  It offers everything that Basic offers and more.  It offers 50 websites instead of 10, 50GB storage, and can support 500 concurrent visitors.  This plan starts at $5.45/month and renews at $21.99/month.</p>
    
    <p>The third plan is called 'online store', it basically has all the same features as choice plus, however, it has a bunch of extra features, including; store analytics, secure online payment, and booking/appointments, just to name a few.  Online store is a good choice for you if you are going to make a store website, like if you are a althletic association, you could use this plan to make a website to sell merchandise.  This plan starts at $9.95/month, and renews at $26.99/month</p>
    
    <p>The fourth plan is called 'pro.'  Pro offers everything that choice plus offers, but it gives you more of it.  Pro comes with 100 websites, 100 GB of storage, 1000 concurrent visitors, and is ideal for having 400 thousand monthly visitors.  Pro offers less fearures than online store, but thats because online store is meant for something else, while pro is meant for what the first two plans are for.  This plan starts out at $13.95/month, and renews at $28.99/month</p>
    
    <h3> <a href="http://www.hostinger.com">Hostinger</a></h3>
    <p>Hostinger is another well known web hosting provider that is highly rated and trusted.  They are rated at 4.6 out of 5 on trust pilot with over 31,000 reviews, which is double that of  Blue Host.  Unlike Bule host, Hostinger only has three plans, or at least those are all that I saw.$</p>
    
    <p>The first plan that Hostinger has is called 'premium.'  Premium starts at $2.99/month and renews at $7.99/month.  With the premium plan you get a number of features including but not limited to: 100 websites, 100Gb storage, free domain, free website migration, unlimited free SSL, weekly backups, and starter commerce.</p>
    
    <p>The second plan that Hostinger offers is called 'Business.'  Business offers much of the same as premium, but just kind of gives you more.  For examply, in the premium plan you get 100 websites, which is the same in business plan.  However, in the business plan, insteasd of 100 GB SSD storage, you get 200 NVME storage.  You also can support more monthly visitors on the business plan.  Business also has access to many more Ai tools than that of premium.</p>
    
    <p>The thrid and final plan that Hostinger offers is called 'cloud startup.'  Cloud start up starts at $7.99/month and renews at $19.99/month.  With cloud start up, you get a large increase of how many websites you get, going from 100 to 300 with this plan.  You also get 300 sub domains.  Other features include but are not limited too: deadicated IP, and priority support, meaning that if you have issues, you are basically more important to support teams.</p>
    
    <h4> <a href="http://www.ionos.com">IONOS</a></h4>
    <p>IONOS is the third web host that I reviewed.  They are yet another well liked and trusted option for when you want to make a website.  Like Blue Host, they also have four plans.  They have a 4.6 out of 5 stars on trust pilot with over 22000 reviews.</p>
    
    <p>The first plan that IONOS offers is called 'Essential.'  This plan starts at $4.00, and I couldn't find a renew price on any of them.  This plan comes with: 1 website, 10GB redundant stoarge, 10 databases, free domain for a year, free wildcard SSL certification, a prefessional email, unmetered bandwidth, 1-click installs, and free 24/7 support.  These are all the features that are listed.</p>
    
    <p>The second plan that IONOS offers is called 'starter.'  This plan starts off at $6.00/month.  You get 10 websites, 100GB storage, 50 databases, basic CPU + MEM resources, and everything else that comes with the previous plan.</p>
    
    <p>For the third plan, which is called 'plus,' it is only $1/month.  As for ythe resources you get, everything is the same as the previous two plans, however you get an enhanced CPU and MEM resource, and also unlimited websites, and storage, as well as databases.</p>
    
    <p>The fourth plan that IONOS offers is called ULtimate.  It stares at $10/month.  Everything it offers is the same as the previous plan, however it comes with maximum CPU and MEM resources.</p>
    
    <p>The one that I would reccomend depends on what the person is lokking for.  If you are foe example a smaller content creator, and you want to have some kind of website, then maybe the essential IONOS plan would work best.  But if you are a large professional company that is going to have lots of traffic, then I think I would reccomend a more expensive plan from either Blue Host or Hostinger.  I think personally I would go with Hostinger because they have many more ratings, are are also rated higher than Blue Host, which leads me to have lightly more trust in them.</p>
